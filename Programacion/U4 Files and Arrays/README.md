## General considerations
</div>

to start the game you can only put 1, 2 or 3 if you try to put another value which is not one of these the program will ask you to put a correct value to start the game, also when you are playing you can only select the columns because the game of connect 4 is played only by selecting the columns, the values of the columns go from 1 to 7 and have a height of 6 when the whole column is filled the program will tell you that this column is full and please select another one, also you have to take into account that only whole values are allowed, no decimals and special characters and letters because the program is not designed to work with these characters.
#### Player 1 is O
#### Player 2 is 0
#### Player Pc is 0
#### Negative values and characters are not accepted
#### In all modes Player 1 is the one who starts the games.
